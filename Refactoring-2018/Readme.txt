This codebase is derived from refactoring 2018 codebase.
Refactoring and adding documentation mostly.

The aim is future TeleOp and Autonomous code will just derive from
RobotDrive code.


TeleOpTest.java is a full functional robot drive code. Just  check
how small the code is. All the drive code is in RobotDrive.


TeleOpTest.java can be used to test out code in RobotDrive.


Need to write a AutoTest.java to test autonomous, just like TeleOp.test
is used to test TeleOp code.
